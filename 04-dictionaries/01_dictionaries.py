# Dictionaries in python are like 'objects' in JS
# ! They are not ordered by an index, thats because they have a key

my_dict = {"key": "value"}

options = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

# Access a value using the key, like accesing an array value using the index
print(options["c"])

user = {"name": "Juan", "country": "Colombia", "age": 22}

print(user)
print(user["country"])
